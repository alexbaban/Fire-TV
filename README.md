# Fire-TV

Amazon Fire TV includes Amazon WebView, an advanced Chromium-based web engine common to all Fire OS devices. This enables the Fire TV to use the latest HTML5 functionality such as GPU accelerated CSS3 transforms and a recent JavaScript engine.

## Getting Started with Web Apps
(https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/getting-started-with-web-apps.html)

### Options for Submitting Apps

* packaged app: is a full-fledged client-side web standards-based application whose assets are bundled together in a ZIP archive for distribution.
* hosted app: is an application whose assets are hosted on a web server. Clients connect to the host and download the app's assets to their device before being able to run the app.
* HTML5 hybrid apps: are platform-native apps that use web content for the user interface.

For hybrid apps, you can build your own wrapper with Cordova or create your own hybrid app and submit it like any other native app. For more information on Cordova, see Apache Cordova (http://cordova.apache.org/). 

For information on using Cordova with Amazon WebView, see the Apache Cordova API topic, Fire OS Platform Guide (http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.4.0/guide_platforms_amazonfireos_index.md.html).
